# RAG Application with LangChain.js

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application utilizing [LangChain.js](https://js.langchain.com/). RAG combines large language models (LLMs) with external data sources to enhance the generation of contextually relevant responses.

## Introduction

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances the capabilities of LLMs by incorporating external data during the generation process. This approach allows for more accurate and contextually relevant outputs, especially when dealing with information not present in the model's original training data.

In this project, I leverage LangChain.js to build a RAG application that retrieves pertinent information from a specified dataset and uses it to generate informed responses.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Utilizes document loaders to ingest data from various sources.
- **Text Splitting**: Implements text splitters to manage large documents efficiently.
- **Vector Storage**: Employs vector databases for efficient similarity searches.
- **LLM Integration**: Integrates with large language models to generate responses based on retrieved data.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AparnaPrasad/RAG-langchain-js.git
   cd RAG-langchain-js
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can start the application using:

```bash
npm start
```

This will initiate the RAG application, allowing you to input queries and receive generated responses based on the integrated data sources.
